# NEMO (Working title)
## Non-profit Education for Maritime Operatives

Open source, decentralised certification system for scuba Divers hosted on the Ethereum blockchain

###Objective

Solves a simple that is currently sold at an inflated price: proof of diving competancy via endorsement of skills from a recognised professional.

NEMO will make use of smart contract technology and be hosted on the Ethereum network. Each user will own their own contract account containing details of their diving credentials. Instructors will be able to endorse and certify other divers based on the skills they have observed in the water using their own contract account.

Divers will be able to show proof of training to schools; diving organisations; and other divers using their contract account and private key.

NEMO courses will meet or exceed minimum standards at each level of certification, as defined by WRSTC standards 

Divers certified under other certification organisations (PADI, SSI, CMAS et al) will be able to import their qualifications on to the NEMO network, which will recognise equivilent qualifications from other certifying bodies.

End user costs will be limited or non-existent (as little as $5 to fuel an account that will last a diver their entire career). 

Scope to add biometric information, contact details, important documents, log dives, disciplinary procedures/quality control, and have a community based steering committee that has voting rights in issues such as changes to the teaching syllabus.
